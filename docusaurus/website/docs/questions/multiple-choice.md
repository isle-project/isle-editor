sidebar_label: Multiple Choice Question
---

An ISLE component that renders a multiple choice question. It supports the case where the learner has to select a single answer and when there might be multiple correct answers and all correct ones must be picked.

## Options

* __question__ | `(string|node)`: the question displayed at the top of the multiple choice component. Default: `''`.
* __solution__ | `(number|array)`: number denoting which answer is correct or an `array` of the correct answer numbers in case the learner should be able to select multiple answers. Default: `none`.
* __answers__ | `array (required)`: an `array` of answer objects. Each answer should be an object with `content` and `explanation` fields, which denote the displayed answer option and an explanation visible after the question has been submitted to explain why the answer is correct or incorrect. Default: `none`.
* __hintPlacement__ | `string`: placement of the hints (either `top`, `left`, `right`, or `bottom`). Default: `'bottom'`.
* __hints__ | `array<(string|node)>`: hints providing guidance on how to answer the question. Default: `[]`.
* __feedback__ | `boolean`: controls whether to display feedback buttons. Default: `true`.
* __disabled__ | `boolean`: controls whether the question is disabled. Default: `false`.
* __chat__ | `boolean`: controls whether the element should have an integrated chat. Default: `false`.
* __provideFeedback__ | `string`: either `full`, `incremental`, or `none`. If `full`, feedback including the correct answer is displayed after learners submit their answers; if `incremental`, feedback is only displayed for the selected answer; if `none`, no feedback is returned. Default: `'incremental'`.
* __disableSubmitNotification__ | `boolean`: controls whether to disable submission notifications. Default: `false`.
* __displaySolution__ | `boolean`: controls whether the solution is displayed upfront. Default: `false`.
* __until__ | `Date`: time until students should be allowed to submit answers. Default: `none`.
* __points__ | `number`: maximum number of points awarded in grading. Default: `10`.
* __style__ | `object`: CSS inline styles. Default: `{}`.
* __onChange__ | `function`: callback invoked every time the selected answer changes; receives the index of the selected question as its sole argument (or an array in case the question is of type "Choose all that apply"). Default: `onChange(){}`.
* __onSubmit__ | `function`: callback invoked after an answer is submitted. Default: `onSubmit(){}`.
