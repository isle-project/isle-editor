Many of the ISLE lessons you will work on will contain questions for you to answer. There are a variety of possible question types, from short answer to multiple choice. Here is an example of a short answer question:

## Submitting

Once you've answered a question and are ready to submit your answer, click the **Submit** button. This records your work so your instructor can see your answer and give you credit for the question.

## Feedback Buttons

Sometimes, your instructor might include feedback buttons (shown above) on individual questions. The left-hand button allows you to note that you are confused on the question; the center button allows you to note that the question makes sense; and the right-hand button allows you to give specific feedback comments in more detail.

## Navigating Questions

Multiple questions may be placed in the same location on the page. If this is the case, you can navigate between the questions by clicking the **Next** button or selecting the questions by number:
