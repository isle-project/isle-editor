# ISLE Components

ISLE lessons are single-page web applications built on top of the [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/) framework. Using ISLE, it becomes possible to quickly author even complex interactive lessons by leveraging the power of components, i.e. custom-made elements with well-designed interfaces that can be re-used and customized. This enables users to quickly build even quite complex e-learning lessons without having to write much code.
