# Getting Started

The acronym ISLE stands for *interactive statistics learning environment*, and lessons created using this framework thus offer a fair amount of interactivity. To facilitate the creation of lessons for statistical concepts and lectures, we have created the ISLE Editor, a desktop-application that can be used to author and preview ISLE lessons before they are deployed online.
